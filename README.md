## Using the Canvas

### Canvas Sections

The canvas is divided into 10 key sections, each focusing on a different aspect of your AI agent:

1. **TARGET USERS**: Define who will interact with your agent (human users, other agents, systems)
2. **AGENT IDENTITY**: Establish the core definition of your agent (name, role, domain, type)
3. **VALUE DELIVERED**: Articulate the value and benefits your agent provides
4. **INPUTS**: Document what triggers or activates your agent
5. **CORE ACTIVITIES**: Detail the key functions and processes your agent performs
6. **OUTPUTS**: Specify what your agent produces or delivers
7. **TOOLS**: List the tools, systems, and resources your agent utilizes
8. **MEMORY**: Define what your agent remembers and learns over time
9. **CONTEXT**: Describe the situational awareness your agent maintains
10. **HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP**: Identify where human intervention is required or beneficial

### Basic Controls

At the bottom of the canvas, you'll find several control buttons:

- **üíæ Save Canvas**: Saves your current work to your browser's local storage

## Working with the Canvas

### Auto-Save Feature

The canvas automatically saves your work to your browser's local storage as you type. A status indicator in the bottom-right corner shows when changes are saved.

### Creating Your First Canvas

1. Click **üìã Load Example** to see how a completed canvas looks
2. Click **üóëÔ∏è Clear All** to start with a blank canvas
3. Fill in each section with details about your AI agent
4. Your work is automatically saved as you type

### Best Practices

- Use bullet points for clarity (‚Ä¢ can be typed with Alt+7 on the numeric keypad)
- Fill in all sections for a complete agent definition
- Be specific about your agent's capabilities and limitations
- Consider the interconnections between different sections
- Use the example as a reference for formatting and level of detail

### Exporting Your Work

- **Text Export**: Creates a plain text file with all your canvas content
- **PDF Export**: Generates a visually formatted PDF document with your canvas layout preserved
- **Backup**: Creates a JSON file that can be used to restore your work on any computer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Save Failed**: If you see a "Save Failed" message, your browser's local storage may be full. Use the "Download Backup" option to save your work.
- **PDF Export Fails**: Some browsers have limitations with PDF generation. Try the text export instead.
- **Display Issues**: For the best experience, use the fullscreen mode or try a different browser.

### Data Recovery

The application creates automatic backups in your browser's local storage. If you accidentally clear your canvas, check if there's a backup by:

1. Closing and reopening the application
2. If your data doesn't reappear, there may not be a recoverable backup

Always use the "Download Backup" option periodically to save important work to your computer.
